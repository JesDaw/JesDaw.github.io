### CPSC 120

* Lab 10
    Lab 10, part 1 one of my favorite projects because it really wasn't until
    the end of the semester until I started to get the hang of our projects.
    I think that this part was the first one I felt completely comfortable on.
    I got some pride with this one since I got to help other groups for the first
    time this year. Even though we were only calculating the area of rectangles I
    thought I had a very good understandings of how functions work so the smooth
    sailing felt nice an I also learned how to call functions from other files with
    heaters which were cool.
 

* Lab 11
    I actually didnâ€™t like this one until right as I was finishing it. I had 
    really had the whole thing finished for hours but something wasn't working
    and I just couldn't understand what.With only about 2 or 3 hours until it 
    was due left I Had finally realized that I was getting the rows and the columns 
    of a 2D vector mixed up. I had a bit of a laugh and a lot of relief, and now I 
    don't think I'll be forgetting the syntax of 2 vectors.


* Lab 12
    Out of all the projects I think the result of this one was the coolest.
    I really wasn't expecting to get into making pictures at all this year
    but this project ended us all making a whole animation which I was really happy
    to see work in the end. Part one also amazed me with how simple animations can be
    to make.
